 
1a.   Write a program that asks the user for degrees in Fahrenheit and converts it to
Celsius, it prints it out in Celsius
 
 (x°F − 32) × 5/9 = x°C
 
1b	Write a program that ask a user for degrees in Celsius and converts it to 
Fahrenheit and prints it out in Fahrenheit  
 	(x°C × 9/5) + 32 = x°F
 
 2.     	Write a program that computes and prints the result of 512−282 / 47·48+5. 
Give  your output in string, integer and float data types
 

3.     	Ask the user to enter a number. Print out the square of the number
Sample output is shown below.

 	How much is the bill? 2000
 	How much percent tip do you want to give? 20
 	
 	Tip:400
 	Total amount paid:2400
 
#Fahrenheit =int(input("Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit:"))
#Celsius = 5.0/9.0 * Fahrenheit - 32
#print (Fahrenheit)
Celsius = int(input("Enter a temperature in Celsius: "))
Fahrenheit = 9.0/5.0 * Celsius + 32
print (Fahrenheit)
